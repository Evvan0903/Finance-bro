# Recovery Checkpoint

## Original objective

Refactor `skills/institutional_equity_research/SKILL.md` into a concise execution guide, then explicitly use the revised skill to create and visually verify a current institutional-style Shell plc research sample in Markdown and PDF.

## Completed tasks

- Recovered and verified the prior completed skill-upgrade checkpoint (`b9b928d`).
- Read the complete `skill-creator` and PDF skill instructions.
- Counted the original `SKILL.md` at 3,157 words.
- Rewrote `SKILL.md` in place to 1,864 words, a 41.0% reduction.
- Consolidated repeated policy, provenance, asset, publication-control, and QA material while retaining the requested analytical workflow and controls.
- Included the requested single copyright red line and single missing-data rule exactly once each.
- Validated the revised skill with the skill-creator quick validator and the repository resource validator.
- Read the revised skill completely and began applying it to Shell plc with a research cutoff of July 15, 2026.
- Collected issuer-appropriate evidence from Shell's FY2025 Form 20-F, FY2025 annual report, Q1 2026 IAS 34 results, July 2026 Q2 update, investor materials, and official transaction releases.
- Confirmed that Shell is a foreign private issuer using Form 20-F and Form 6-K rather than domestic Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
- Reconciled FY2021-FY2025 historical statements, recast FY2023-FY2025 segment data, Q1 2026 actuals, and July 2026 management guidance.
- Created the complete compact report at `samples/shell_equity_research_sample.md` with all 13 requested sections and a revised-skill conformance appendix.
- Created two original, source-noted chart assets under `samples/assets/`.
- Generated `samples/shell_equity_research_sample.pdf` as a nine-page landscape report using the project's PDF-capable environment.
- Rendered and visually inspected every final PDF page after correcting the initial list formatting and segment-chart pagination.
- Verified all required sections, key formulas, citations, PDF links, source labels, and actual-versus-guidance treatment with deterministic checks.
- Re-ran skill validation, resource validation, whitespace checks, and the project test suite; all 33 tests passed.

## Remaining tasks

None after the final local checkpoint commit. No remote push is authorized or required.

## Current status

Complete. The skill is 1,864 words versus 3,157 originally, a 41.0% reduction. The Shell Markdown sample, two original charts, and nine-page PDF are complete and visually verified. The PDF contains 65 working link annotations, deterministic QA passed, both skill validators passed, and all 33 project tests passed.

## Files modified

- `skills/institutional_equity_research/SKILL.md`
- `samples/shell_equity_research_sample.md`
- `samples/shell_equity_research_sample.pdf`
- `samples/assets/shell_cash_generation.png`
- `samples/assets/shell_segment_earnings.png`
- `RECOVERY.md`
- `TODO.md`

## Next recommended step

Read the final report or PDF and make changes only for a newly identified defect or a new user request. Do not regenerate the completed sample from scratch.

## Assumptions and pending decisions

- Research cutoff is July 15, 2026; Q1 2026 is the latest reported quarter, while the July 7 Q2 update is management guidance rather than reported results.
- FY2025 and Q1 2026 issuer figures are primarily USD and may not sum because of rounding.
- Scenario values are explicitly labeled analyst assumptions and use transparent enterprise cash-flow proxy formulas rather than unsupported target-price precision.
- Market-value calculations require a dated LSE price and a disclosed GBP/USD conversion; they will be treated as permitted third-party market inputs, not issuer-reported facts.
- The PDF uses original styling and charts without Shell logos or proprietary report design elements.
- The report's conformance appendix records four guidance gaps: assumption-confirmation semantics, energy-sector modeling minimums, issuer-APM bridge format, and synchronization of market value, ADS/share count, pending issuance, and net debt dates.

## Recovery procedure

1. Read `RECOVERY.md` and `TODO.md` completely.
2. Inspect the latest local commit and working tree.
3. Treat the repository as the source of truth.
4. Resume only the first unchecked task.
5. Preserve existing code and do not push checkpoint commits.
